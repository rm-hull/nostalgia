# IGR

IGR is a program I wrote for the BBC Micro in 1988. I have absolutely no
recollection of writing it, so discovering the screenshots below was an
unexpected nice surprise.

I did submit an article for _Micro User_ for a WIMP (Windows Icon Mouse
Pointer) system, which was published across two issues in 1989 (details to
follow): this was similar to IGR, but was more of a database/card-index system
and graphically less sophisticated.

IGR stands for Icon Graphics Representation. No source code exists any more,
just these scans of printed screenshots.
