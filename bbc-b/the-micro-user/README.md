# The Micro User

I had a number of article published in _The Micro User_ - a long-since extinct
magazine dedicated to the BBC range of computers. Kris Adcock kindly scanned
these pages in and send me links to them some time back in 2011. I'd forgotten
they spelt my name wrong in the second article. 

Shortly after the ADFS catalogue program was published in October 1988, a
fellow pupil at school (Michael Cain, possibly?) came up to me and gingerly
asked if it was me wot wrote an article in a magazine. I replied affirmatively,
and he said that his dad thought it was great. So proud of myself...

The database/card-index articles - I seem to remember that these were submitted
for GCE 'A'-level Computing assignments. 

I also recall that _The Micro User_ paid out something like Â£250-300 per
article (no idea whether this was generous or not, but it definitely was to me
at the time).
