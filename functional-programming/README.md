# Functional Programming with GLIDE

I was an undergraduate at the University of York between 1989 and 1993, where
I did a M.Eng in Computer Systems and Software Engineering. I was sponsored
by GEC Marconi and spend summers working variously on battle simuations in 
SMALLTALK-80, processing RADAR with FFT's and designing/assembing breadboard 
circuits and writing assembler for 68HC11 controllers.

Somewhere during 1990 I took a course on Functional Programming. 1990. Twenty four
years ago. I can no longer find any mention, however brief, of GLIDE on the 
internet - our preferred functional language. This, of course, was before Haskell 
had been designed (although looking at the Wikipedia page, only just).

I had (I am certain) the book by _Richard Bird_ and _Philip Wadler_ below; I
distinctly remember the red and white cover, but it has been long since mislaid.

I however _do_ own a book on programming in Miranda which dates from the same era, 
although I never recall _actually_ programming with Miranda.

## Problems

Colin Runciman was the lecturer I most remember for his excellent course on 
Functional Programming, another on Computer-aided Theorem Proving using 
_Cambridge LCF_ which I think bears a remarkable likeness to Standard ML. 
There is possibly some material for that I can dig up.

Here are some [Functional Programming Problems](https://raw2.github.com/rm-hull/nostalgia/master/functional-programming/functional-programming-problems.pdf) 
that we were expected to provide solutions for (in GLIDE) back in 1990. They 
will be evidently apparent to any practising FP-er now, and I may try and 
re-solve them in a more modern language time permitting.

Note that I have circled some of the questions - these may have been the ones
I actually did, or was supposed to do...who knows! Also, note that the list 
starts from 0!

## V045

V045 was the computer lab - lots of amber screen VT220's - connected to the 
departmental Orion UNIX system, on which we ran the GLIDE programs, hacked of
course with vi or Emacs.

Here are the [notes for GLIDE users](https://raw2.github.com/rm-hull/nostalgia/master/functional-programming/notes-for-glide-users.pdf) from 1990.
