# Word Invaders

[Word Invaders]() was a program written in BBC Basic - at the time I had a BBC Master
Compact (as below). I think this was an assignment for GCE 'O' Computing. It was
an educational game, designed to help children with dyslexia: The invaders were word
parts like 'ear', 'ir', 'or', 'are', 'our', and so on, and the child was given a 
partial word like S---CH and had to shoot the correct invader that fitted the world.

I sold the BBC computer in around 1988, and bought a Cambridge Z88 instead.

## Program Notes

1. I don't appear to have liked extranous spaces or the use of indenting, or comments.
2. At line 100, I have no idea who SID or ERIC were, but NICK and NAFAN (Nathan)
   where my friends.
3. This is the earliest program listing I could find - 28 years old!
4. Trying to recall what the *VIILWIV* string is supposed to represent... it's not
   roman numerals (W is not a legal number).

If I can locate a javascript BBC emulator, I'll key the game in and push the source
here.
